# LagGoggles Legacy <img height="70" src="docs/logo.png">
Intuitive lag hunting!<br>
LagGoggles is a profiler where you can see timings in the world, visually. It comes with a custom GUI using a configurable keybind. It's compatible with [SpongeForge](https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeForge) and [Mixin](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin)!<br>
You can use LagGoggles as a player too! This is my attempt to create an understanding of what causes lag on a server to regular players.<br>
I noticed some common misconceptions like having machines spread out over different chunks causes less lag than putting it in one chunk.<br>
With LagGoggles, you can look around and see that alot of small things like pipes or cables cause a tiny bit of lag most of the time, often resulting in more lag than a machine right next to the source would.

LagGoggles can also profile clientside FPS as of version 4.0!

## Features
* Sponge compatible (Try the THIN version first!)
* Teleporting to sources of lag
* Client GUI, including overlay and clickable menus
* Colour scale for easy spotting of sources of lag.
* Calculations are done on the client, so each client can have a different colour scale.
* Clientside FPS support!
   * Checks render time for Entities, Tile entities and event subscribers
   * It's very young, but it should give some insight in what may cause FPS issues.
* Config for client:
    * Custom gradients
    * Colorblindess support
* Config for server
    * Custom permissions for players (non-operators)

## Configuration
* Drop the jar in the /mods folder
* Serverside configuration is not required and has no effect.
* Clients can edit the config to change the colour scale.

## How it works
At startup [Mixin](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin) handles each class being loaded. On the server side, this mod hooks into the loading mechanism. This is the same mechanism [SpongeForge](https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeForge) uses, that's why it's compatible.<br>
<br>
Entities, blocks and event-subscribers are timed using System.nanotime() before and after the tick() and update() methods. These times are being recorded and sent to the client when the profiler is done.

## Benefits
* Visualisation of various sources of lag
* Learn your players to build lag-free bases.

## Dependencies
You can download the latest release here. The ONLY difference between THIN and FAT is that **FAT ships Mixin, which is a library that LagGoggles needs in order to function.** It's possible that another mod already ships Mixin or has another version. Generally speaking, LagGoggles can handle most Mixin releases well. A known mod to ship Mixin is SpongeForge. **If you have SpongeForge or another mod that requires a different version of Mixin, choose the THIN release**.
